# BankSystem
Built a bank system holding usersâ€™ bank accounts using C++ and runs in a terminal.

Two versions
  - release.mak: Makefile that compiles a version for production.
  - debug.mak: Makefile that compiles a version for the developer. Shows in console output what is saved, read, and written when actions are done.
